This project provided an opportunity to further my skills in React, including the implementation of dark mode and mobile responsiveness. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of these concepts and their practical application in web development

## About The Project 

Text Util is a web application that allows users to manipulate and manage their text. It provides a range of functions including converting text to uppercase or lowercase, copying, removing extra spaces, counting vowels, and displaying word and character count. Additionally, the application provides an estimated reading time and a preview feature. The user interface is user-friendly and includes a dark mode for night time use. The application is fully mobile responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on any device

## Technologies Used

This project was built using ReactJS, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, as well as Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework. The project also makes use of JavaScript and Bootstrap CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) to efficiently deliver necessary resources to the user's device. The project was hosted on Netlify, a cloud-based platform that provides continuous deployment and hosting services for web applications
